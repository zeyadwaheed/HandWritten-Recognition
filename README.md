# HandWritten-Recognition
Handwriting recognition is a challenging problem in the field of deep learning, with applications spanning from digitizing historical documents to enhancing human-computer
interaction. This abstract explores the application of the Convolutional Recurrent
Neural Network (CRNN) model to address the handwriting recognition problem and
achieve accurate text prediction. The handwritten text recognition problem involves
converting handwritten text images into machine-readable text. While traditional
methods have made significant progress, deep learning techniques have revolutionized
this field by enabling the development of more robust and accurate models.

Handwriting recognition is a compelling problem within the realm of deep learning, where
the objective is to transform handwritten text into digital form for applications ranging from
historical document preservation to efficient data entry. One of the remarkable approaches in
this domain involves the utilization of Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNN).
In this endeavor, we delve into the world of handwriting recognition, employing a CRNN
model to convert handwritten text into accurate textual predictions. The dataset that fuels
this endeavor is sourced from Kaggle, comprising an extensive collection of more than four
hundred thousand handwritten names, generously contributed through charity projects.
While character recognition has shown remarkable prowess in converting machine-printed
fonts into digital text, the challenge escalates when dealing with handwritten characters.
The inherent variability in individual writing styles introduces complexities that traditional

methods often struggle to overcome. This is where deep learning, specifically the CRNN
model, steps in as a promising solution to tackle the nuances of handwritten text recognition.
The dataset we employ for this endeavor is both vast and diverse. It encompasses a grand
total of 206,799 first names and 207,024 surnames, meticulously collected and curated for
this project. To facilitate the development and evaluation of our CRNN model, the dataset
is thoughtfully partitioned into three subsets: a training set comprising 331,059 examples,
a testing set with 41,382 samples, and a validation set of equal size, ensuring robust model
performance across different data splits.
The core of this venture revolves around the analysis of hundreds of thousands of images, each
representing a handwritten name. Within this dataset, you’ll find these transcribed images
thoughtfully organized into distinct sets, each serving a crucial role in the training, testing,
and validation of our CRNN model. This effort is not just an exploration of deep learning’s
capabilities but also a testament to the potential of harnessing advanced technology to bridge
the gap between the analog and digital realms of handwritten text recognition
